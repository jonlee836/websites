	"Mamayev Kurgan",
	"A strategic hill that splits the city from north to south. Despite the heavily entrenched Soviet defenders, it was captured by the Wehrmacht on September 13, 1942. Control of the hill was of such importance for both sides, that entire divisions were destroyed down to the last man in order to defend or capture it. The sheer carnage for control of Mamayev Kurgen raged until January 26, 1943. The hill's height fell from 102ft down to 98ft. Nothing would grow on the hill until spring of 1944.",
