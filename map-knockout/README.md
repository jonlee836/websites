Welcome to my udacity neighborhood map project!

There are 3 marker types.

1.) Landmarks that are historically significant to the city as a whole.

2.) Landmarks with historical significance to the Red Army.

3.) Landmarks with historical significance to the Wehrmacht.

Click on the markers to view information about the historical site.

Click on the menu button in the top left to toggle on/off the other 2 marker types.

Click on the TOGGLE MENU button in the navigation menu to have the navigation bar close when you click the map.
